# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer
Instance methods are created by using the prototype object (`Prototype.prototype.propertyName` = `value`). The same goes for their methods (`Prototype.prototype.methodName` = `function() {...}`). 

Class properties can merely be initialized before the constructor (this is mainly for private **static** properties, which are exclusive to the superclass object) and public properties (the properties that will be passed down and inherited). 
Instances of classes get their properties from the superclass constructor, and their methods handed down (think like a Dog (superclass) having puppies (instances/subclasses)). 

```js

class FamilyPet = {
    static breed = "Beagle";
    #allDogs = [];

    constructor (name, height, weight, favoriteToy, favoriteTreat) {
        this.petName = name,
        this.petHeight = height,
        this.petWeight = weight,
        this.petToy = favoriteToy,
        this.petTreat = favoriteTreat
    };

    addToFamilyHistory() {
        FamilyPet.#allDogs.push(this.petName)
        return [...#allDogs]
    };

    getName() {
        return this.petName
    };

    getMedicalInfo() {
        return [{`${this.petHeight}`}, {`${this.petWeight}`}]
    };

    getToy() {
        return this.petToy
    };

    giveTreat() {
        return `You gave ${this.petName} a ${this.favoriteTreat}!`
    }

}

```
